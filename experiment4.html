    <P>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer
        and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bangalore
        in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history
        of the sport.[4] In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli
        has also contributed to India's successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022, and winning the 2011 World Cup
        and the 2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four Indian cricketers who have played over 500 matches for
        India. Kohli is the fourth-highest run-scorer in international cricket and stands second in the list of
        cricketers by number of international centuries scored.[5]
